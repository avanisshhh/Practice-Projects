      Alfred had succeeded Æthelred as king of Wessex in 871, and almost faced
      defeat against the Danish Vikings until his decisive victory at the Battle
      of Edington in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled Northumbria,
      East Anglia and eastern Mercia, leaving only Wessex and western Mercia
      under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s Æthelred, Lord of the
      Mercians, the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and
      married his daughter Æthelflæd, and around 886 Alfred adopted the new
      title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not
      subject to Danish rule.
